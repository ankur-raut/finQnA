Three sources briefed on OpenAI's recent pitch to investors said the organization 
expects $200 million in revenue next year and $1 billion by 2024.

The forecast, first reported by Reuters, represents how some in Silicon Valley 
are betting the underlying technology will go far beyond splashy and sometimes flawed public demos.

OpenAI was most recently valued at $20 billion in a secondary share sale, one of the sources said. 
The startup has already inspired rivals and companies building applications atop its generative 
AI software, which includes the image maker DALL-E 2. OpenAI charges developers licensing its technology 
about a penny or a little more to generate 20,000 words of text, and about 2 cents to create an image 
from a written prompt, according to its website.
